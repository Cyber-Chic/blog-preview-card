## Overview
This project contains my blog preview card web design replication.  It is the fourth challenge that I completed on Frontend Mentor.

### The challenge

To create a blog preview card and have it look as close to the original design as possible.  

Users must be able to: 

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
